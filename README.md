# Animal Match Three Game

A two-stage demo of a 2D match-three game built on Unity Engine. Match three or more of the same type of tiles together, either vertically or horizontally, to pop them and earn a score according to the number of tiles popped. Special tiles appear when special shapes are formed or when more than three tiles are popped.
